Numba Integration Test
======================

As part of the continuous quality assurance of the `Numba project
<https://numba.pydata.org/>`_ we test the compatability of Numba with the
latests releases of specific libraries that make heavy use of Numba. The target
Numba version to test with, will be the latest version of the git
``master`` branch where the test suite passed.
